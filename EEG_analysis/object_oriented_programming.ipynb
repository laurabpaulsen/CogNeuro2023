    "# Introduction to Python classes\n",

    "This notebook aims to provide a brief overview of this concept to enhance understanding of the syntax used when utilising the tools in the MNE toolbox.\n",

    "To begin, a class must be defined, which serves as the blueprint for creating objects. Let's use the following example:"

    "`__init__` is a special method in Python classes, also known as a constructor method. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created and is used to initialise the attributes of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example class Dog, `__init__ `takes three arguments: name, breed and age. These values are passed to the method when an object of the class is created, and are used to initialize the name and breed attributes of the object.\n",

    "### self\n",
    "In Python, the `self` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class. It is used to access and modify the attributes and methods of the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object, the object is automatically passed as the first argument to the method. This first argument is typically named self by convention, but it can be named anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the the birthday method, self.age is used to access and increase the age attribute of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that when you call a method on an object, you don't need to pass the self argument, python takes care of passing it when using the syntax seen in the following code chunk. "
